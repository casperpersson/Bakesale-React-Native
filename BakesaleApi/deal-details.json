More commonly known as \"Thai massage,\" the practitioner essentially \"gives yoga\" TO the receiver, while they lay passively. Quite unlike and far superior to any other bodywork you've received, Thai Yoga Therapy gets the body moving in all directions to heal the internal system. \n\nWhile our culture has branded bodywork as a quick fix for acute back or neck pain, Thai Yoga Therapy effectively treats chronic pain and other health problems when received regularly. The 7-Day Therapeutic Program is seven Thai Yoga sessions, scheduled 1-2 times per week, each session focusing on a different physical attitude. \n\nSessions take place in the clients home or in my Park Slope or Gramercy studio locations.\n\n50% of these proceeds will go directly to hurricane relief for the Caribbean.
